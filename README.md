## WORKING INSTRUCTIONS

Hi everyone!  
We've been tasked with describing all the git commands we know so far in the form of Markdown Syntax.

I believe the main point of this excercise is *not* to test our knowledge of git commands, but to force us to **work in a team using git and github in tandem.**

This being said, please follow this workflow to ensure we're all on the same page:

1. Fork this repository on GitHub.
2. Clone the forked repository into your terminal. (make sure you clone it into a free directory)
3. **Create a branch** with the same name as the command you are assigned; eg: git switch config / make sure you are working in this branch from now on.
4. **Create a mardown file (.md)** with the same name as the command; eg: touch config.md 
5. Go crazy! Open up VSCode and write all about this command. Help yourself with online resources to make sure there's enough information, and utilize markdown to its full potential to make your page look pretty.
6. Once your file is ready for its first commit, open up your terminal and make sure you use *git add* to add your file to the staging area, and then *git commit -m "comment here"* to commit your changes.
7. Finally, time to push! using *git push -u origin [branch name]* your whole branch and its changes will be pushed to the github repository.
8. Time to change it up. Open your browser and go to github.com, there you'll have to look at **your repositories** and select "git_commands".
9. Once there, create a pull request, so that your latest commit will be integrated into the main branch, aswell as your branch and its subsequent files.
10. Almost done! Once your pull request is done, it will have to be approved by a user with such privileges. In this case, all of us have these privileges, so navigate to the pull request and accept it/merge. If there are any conflicts make sure to resolve them before proceeding.
